# KerlkraftwerkGame

During our lecture "Software Engineering Praktikum", our task was to implement any kind of mini game.

The main focus of this course was to see how a Software Engineer plans and approaches new projects.

My group decided to develop a very basic Jump N' Run game. 
The character you control is a Samurai who is trying to escape and during his escape, he has to face a couple of obstacles. 
You can control the Samurai by pressing the SpaceBar to make him jump - press twice to DoubleJump.

As the game continues to get more difficult, the amount of throwing stars coming towards the Samurai increase and the gravity suddenly changes.
