# Introduction 
During our lecture "Software Engineering Praktikum", our task was to implement a mini game using C#.

We decided to implement a cool little Jump N' Run game where the player has to control a Samurai and save him from the flying throwing stars coming towards him.
You can jump by pressing the SpaceBar - pressing twice makes you DoubleJump.

But be careful! The gravity might suddenly change. :)



# Build and Test
In order to run our game, navigate to the project folder and press on the "Solution" file named "KerlkraftSolution.sln".
Once you are there, press on "Run" and enjoy our little mini game.
